        <h3>Datathon and Machine Learning Competition, Indiana University</h3>
        <div class="meta">July 2025 - August 2025</div>
        <p>At Indiana University, I researched offensive language detection with Dr. Daniel Miehling, Professor Gunther Jikeli Jr., and Professor Damir Cavar. I built and annotated a large dataset of social media posts, fine-tuned a HuggingFace transformer model in PyTorch, and improved its accuracy in detecting hate speech. Beyond the technical work, I explored the ethical questions around NLP, including how AI shapes content moderation, fairness, and policy. As the only high school student participating in the program, our team placed 3rd, earning recognition from the university.</p>

        <h3>New York Academy of Science (NYAS) Ethical AI Challenge, Top Team Award</h3>
        <div class="meta">August 2024 - December 2024</div>
        <p>I collaborated with international researchers under the mentorship of Professor Christos Liambas, a digital forensics and computer science expert, to investigate the ethical implications of AI in education. As part of this work, I researched, designed, and piloted an innovative AI-driven solution aimed at addressing ethical challenges and implementation barriers in the education sector, helping to pioneer advancements in responsible AI. To ground the project in real-world needs, I partnered with three school districts across the United States, India, and Australia, gathering feedback and running controlled test groups that directly informed the development of the solution.</p>
